Reliability Calculator

This network reliability calculation tool facilitates exploration of tradeoffs among the following variables:
- The total number n of independent identical components in a network
- The minimum number m of these components which must remain functional in order to avoid network failure
- The length of time t for which the network must successfully function
- The individual component failure rate ?
- The network reliability R(n, m, t, ?)

This tool is able to solve for any one of these five variables. The user selects the variable of interest using the "Solve for" menu, while specifying values for all other variables in their respective fields. All four independent variables are required when solving for network reliability. When solving for one of the independent variables, a target network reliability is required.
